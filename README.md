- Discord bot made for [one specific server](https://dsc.gg/llama). It most likely will not function properly on other discord servers.
- Invitation of this bot to other server is blocked. You'll have to host the bot yourself if you want it on your discord server.
- It's not designed with ease of use for others in mind. This is a personal project, so you'll have to figure things out on your own. Documentation will not be provided.
- The bot is still under construction, so you may find a ton of inconsistencies and missing features.
- WarBrokers feature is completely unavailable for the public, and it wil stay that way.
- The bot requires Python version 3.9 or greater.
